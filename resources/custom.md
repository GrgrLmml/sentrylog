### Log Analysis Request
I have a chunk of Nginx logs listed below. Please analyze them for signs of sophisticated or targeted cyber-attacks. 
Focus on identifying actions that go beyond standard break-in attempts and may indicate a targeted threat. Under standard 
break-in attempts, we mean the usual suspects like php vulnerabilities, directory traversal, and other common attacks. Just ignore them.

### Log Chunk
YOUR_LOG_CHUNK_HERE
### Instructions
1. Identify any patterns or entries in the logs that suggest a targeted attack.
2. For each suspected attack, provide:
   - A brief description of the nature of the attack.
   - The origin of the attack, including any available details like IP addresses, request headers, or other relevant identifiers.
   - A short recommendation on steps to take to improve security and mitigate this type of attack.
   - Include references to any specific log entries that support your analysis.
   - Feel free to use emojis, ASCII art, or other creative elements to make your response more engaging.
3. If you don't find any evidence of a targeted attack, respond with a simple "All green ✅". Don't respond with long common place test, like "I did not find any clear evidence of a targeted cyber-attack in the provided Nginx logs. The log entries appear to be standard user activity and requests for the application's resources, such as CSS, JavaScript, and font files. There are no unusual request patterns, suspicious access attempts, or signs of malicious activity that would indicate a sophisticated or targeted attack."

### Additional Information
- Assume the server hosts a location analytics application. Watch out for attempts to access geospatial data, location tracking, or any other sensitive information.
- Consider any uncommon request patterns, unusual times of access, or abnormal request types as potential indicators of a targeted attack.

### Expected Output
For each identified attack, please format your response as follows:
- **Type of Attack**: Describe the nature and method of the attack.
- **Origin**: Detail the origin of the attack, including any specific identifiers.
- **Recommendation**: Provide actionable security advice to prevent similar attacks in the future.
Remember, if you don't find any evidence of a targeted attack, respond with a simple "All green ✅" nothing else! Keep your responses concise and to the point.
